# CodeChallenge-MovieApp

An Android movie app that demonstrates Clean Architecture and is written in Kotlin.


# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer â€” the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.


# Architecture Layers

The application consists of three layers:

The domain layer, the data layer, and the presentation layer.
